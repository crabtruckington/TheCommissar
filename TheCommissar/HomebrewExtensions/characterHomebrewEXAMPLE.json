/* All entries should go between the [ and ] brackets */
/* All entries MUST be in the following format:

  "name": "Tau",
  "bpcost": "20",
  "racialBonus": "Tau: +2 Fellowship. +2DN to all Interaction tests against characters with the <Imperium> keyword. -2DN to all Interaction tests against characters without the <Imperium> keyword.",

/* and please note the comma after each entry EXCEPT the last, see the example file if youre not familiar with JSON */
/* you can use \u00A0 to set a non-breaking space within long descriptions to prevent them from wrapping strangely, ex: long\u00A0string */
/* use \u2011 for a nonbreaking hyphen ex: Two\u2011\Handed */
/* All values must be strings!! Do not use other datatypes, you will probably receive an error or crash the program */
/*  Prerequisite Validation will NOT work for Homebrew races, a default check of 1 strength will be used instead. You may not have less than 1 in any attribute so this shouldnt matter. */
