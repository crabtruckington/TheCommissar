/* All values must be strings!! Do not use other datatypes, you will probably receive an error or crash the program */
/* IMPORTANT: Objectives are a bit wonky as theres no good way to handle these. You should limit each line to approximately 55 characters, and end each line with "\n    " (ie, \n followed by 4 spaces). New list entries should be proceeded by \n\n to achieve correct spacing */
/*  Prerequisite Validation will NOT work for Homebrew races, a default check of 1 strength will be used instead. You may not have less than 1 in any attribute so this shouldnt matter. */
